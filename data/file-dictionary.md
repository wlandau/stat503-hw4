# 13Falla.csv

Raw data, STAT 101 fall semester 2013. One of 3 semesters.

# 14Falla.csv

Same as 13Falla.csv, but for Fall 2014.

# 14Springa.csv

Same as 13Falla.csv, but for Spring 2014.

# allInclusionMat.csv

Generated by ../R/allInclusionMat.R.

Aggregate of 13Falla.csv, 14Falla.csv, and 14Springa.csv. The NA's from the 3 semesters are zeroes here, and an inclusion matrix is provided as well.

../R/allInclusionMat.R aggregates the 3 semesters by matching up topics, averaging some variables in the process (Ch1 matches T01, Ch2 matches T02 and T04, etc).  NA's are treated as zeroes, and an inclusion matrix is generated (intro_HANDIN, quantitative_HANDIN, etc). Each entry in the inclusion matrix is proportional to the number of turned-in assignments for the given student and topic. 

# cleanGrades.Rda

Requires mainClusters.Rda. Generated by impure.R. Uses knn imputation on groups 3 and 4 (see GeneralMissingClusters.R) to output clean data for the 3 semesters, ready for clustering. The 3 data frames are called fall13, fall14, and spring14.

# mainClusters.Rda

Generated by GeneralMissingClusters.R. See the comment at the head of the script for details.

# wb.ratio.rds

Generated by wb.ratio.plot() in num-clusters.R. An RDS file (use readRDS() and saveRDS()) specifying wb.ratio for multiple numbers of clusters and multiple clustering methods (one kmeans, multiple hierarchical).
